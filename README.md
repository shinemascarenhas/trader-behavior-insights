# Trader Behavior Insights – Sentiment-Driven Analysis

This project explores how market sentiment (Fear and Greed Index) affects trader behavior using Hyperliquid historical trade data.

## 📊 Objective
To identify behavioral patterns such as:
- Average trade size during different sentiment phases
- PnL trends in fear vs greed conditions

## 📁 Files

- `hyperliquid_trades.csv`: Historical trades dataset
- `fear_greed_index.csv`: Market sentiment dataset

## 🔍 Key Insights
- Trade sizes are larger during **Greed** and **Neutral** phases
- Smaller trades during **Extreme Fear** suggest conservative risk behavior

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- Jupyter Notebook
